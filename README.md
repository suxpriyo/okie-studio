## Describtion

The ***okie group*** was formed in the early days of elementary school when a group of sixteen children from the same neighborhood and school began to bond over shared interests and adventures. Their connection was instantaneous, marked by a collective love for imaginative play, outdoor exploration, and creative projects.
